## 📊 Algorithm Comparison

| Algorithm | Best For | Pros | Cons |
|-----------|----------|------|------|
| **K-Means** | Spherical clusters, known K | Fast, simple | Requires K, sensitive to outliers |
| **Hierarchical** | Unknown K, tree structure | No K needed, deterministic | Slow O(n³), sensitive to noise |
| **DBSCAN** | Arbitrary shapes, outliers | Finds outliers, no K needed | Parameter sensitive, varying density |
